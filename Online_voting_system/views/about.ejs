            <p class="parah">I've worked on the University of Regina campus for over 20 years, and have only recently become aware
                that the University of Regina Staff Assembly is something I can join, rather than something I would have to
                benominated for! Now that I've joined, I'd like to do my part toward letting others on campus knowthat
                this organization exists, that it does a great deal of good for each and every person on theUniversity of Regina
                staff, and that they can all join and help with the good work. UofR has been good to me - I started as a
                telephone operator and am now an SAO I. I've been in the Haas School the entire time,and would like to
                make more contacts across the entire campus - BSA seems to be a great way tomeet people and help make
                University of Regina a better place to work for us all. For these reasons, I'd like tobe considered for the BSA
                Coordinating Committee.</p>
